## Abstract
There are a number of new Managed Service Provider (MSP) companies that have been “born in the cloud”, therefore have the expertise and best practices to help organizations protect and optimize their cloud data protection strategy. From an organization's point of view, if you lack the skills to manage and protect workloads as they shift or as they are created in the public cloud, it’s natural that you would seek out the assistance of a company that does. This ensures the best technology is used to protect those workloads and the data being created by them. Join Veeam's Anthony Spiteri and Sam Nicholls, as they take a look at how Veeam is bringing these worlds together with our Backup for Public Cloud products now integrating into Veeam Service Provider Console, offering both end users and managed service providers added value and services with the best data and workload protection.
