## Abstract
When faced with a disaster, your recovery plan is put to the test! What order did those VMs need to start up in again? What was the command I needed to run to get that app running on a new IP? What was the VLAN ID for the DR Site? Take the guess work out of your DR plan with Veeam Recovery Orchestrator!

This session will provide an overview of Veeam Recovery Orchestrator (VRO) and the capabilities that will help any company recover from disaster in record time. Whether you need to quickly restore an application from backup that's been hit, or invoke a full site failover, VRO can help ensure you're in the best possible position. Don’t wait until disaster strikes to know you are capable of achieving your recovery objectives. We’ll take a deeper look into Veeam Recovery Orchestrator’s automated testing and SLA dashboards and how they can identify potential impacts to your DR plan before it’s too late.
