## Abstract
There is no better teacher than one’s enemies, and no better way to learn than by studying their attacks. Join Jeff Reichard, VP of Solution Strategy at Veeam, and Harry Coker, Former CIA and NSA Senior Executive, for a frank discussion on the evolving public sector threat landscape.

 

We’ll focus specifically on threats faced by both federal and state/local governments, highlighting how Veeam can support cyber defense strategies to ensure mission continuity and protect citizen data and service delivery against malware. Our discussion will contrast the unique ways public sector organizations must combat threats vs other types of organizations.
