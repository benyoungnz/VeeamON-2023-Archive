## Abstract
The hyperscale public cloud is a powerful and revolutionary tool that businesses are adopting for workloads and applications of all sizes. Being able to spin up and spin down resources instantly has increased the speed of innovation, but there is a cost associated with these resources. As with your business, the hyper-scalers are also trying to make money, and to quote Rick Vanover, Veeam Senior Director of Product Strategy, “The cloud is not a charity.” Small mistakes can have significant and expensive consequences.

 

So how can we prevent expensive consequences from happening to us? How can we ensure that we are minimizing costs whenever possible? The quick answer is, there is no silver bullet that will take away all these challenges.

 

Join this session where you will be able to take away a number of resources, tools, best practices to monitor and hopefully lower your costs. These include:


- How to minimize or eliminate egress charges
- How to estimate the costs of your backups in capacity and archive tier
- How immutability impact storage costs
- How can the placement of a server impact compute costs
- Setting a budget in a hyper-scaler and being notified if/when costs exceed a specific threshold
- What is the best VM/EC2 instance size to use for your Veeam workloads


[Note: This is an on-demand session, so you do not need to attend at the scheduled time to view it]
