## Abstract
The beauty of Microsoft solutions is their connected offerings from edge to data center to cloud. While Windows has become ubiquitous for endpoint devices and servers, Windows has also been positioned as an important gateway to the cloud. As organizations increase their usage of Microsoft Cloud solutions for production workloads – whether born-in-the-cloud, migrated, or refactored – it then stands to reason that backup and recovery should span the same edge-to-cloud project pipeline.

 

In this session, both new and power users of Veeam will see how seamlessly the tool they know, trust, and love every day seamlessly extends to Azure. While backup of workloads like Azure VMs, Azure SQL, Azure Files and more is native to the cloud, the Veeam DNA is consistent across all infrastructures your organization is transforming to. From diagrams to demos, this session will be full of actionable insights you can take into your next project with Veeam!
