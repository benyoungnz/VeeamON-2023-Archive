## Abstract
Everybody wants to be prepared against downtime, but building and maintaining a disaster recovery solution is time consuming, strains resources and can be expensive. Let IT focus efforts on revenue generating activities and leave disaster recovery to the experts.

 

In this session, Veeam subject matter experts will discuss how service providers can help with planning, testing and orchestrating a comprehensive DR strategy so you can quickly resume operations when a disaster such as ransomware strikes.

 

Attendees will learn about the strategic business value service providers can bring to your organization including:


- Cost savings
- Scalability
- Low RTPO replication
- Detailed reporting and monitoring capabilities
- And more!


We will also share real-world examples of how service providers have helped organizations of all sizes to protect their data and minimize the impact of unexpected events.
