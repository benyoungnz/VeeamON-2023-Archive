## Abstract
In this session we'll sit down withÂ  Corey Dunn, Technical Services Manager of the Calgary Police Service and Archana Venkatraman, Research Director, Cloud Data Management, IDC Europe. The Calgary Police are a long-time Veeam user, but in the last several years their IT estate has undergone major changes and challenges.

Join us to learn how Calgary has adapted to remote work, cloud and M365 adoption, and growing critical data sources such as body cam footage -- all while staying safe and compliant with Veeam. IDC will put these experiences in context by looking at trends in security and ransomware, cyber insurance, and enterprise resiliency based on IDC's latest industry research.

This talk will be packed with good information and actionable insights for all Veeam customers, but especially for our public sector attendees. See you there!
