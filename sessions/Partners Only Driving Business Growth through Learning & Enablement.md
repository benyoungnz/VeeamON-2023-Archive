## Abstract
Staying on top of the latest technology trends, selling techniques and solutions engineering know-how is paramount to ensuring growth, customer retention and satisfaction. Partners need to ensure that their knowledge is up to date and that they are advising their customers on the best and latest Veeam Solutions and Services. This session will explore the enhanced benefits of:


- The new VMSP/VMTSP 2023 online training. How the badging works, the focus on specialist solutions areas and how this is linked with the Veeam Partner Program and the New Veeam Partner Competency Program.
- The updated VMCE/VMCA technical certification courses. We will discuss what has been updated, what this means for your technical team members and the new knowledge this will bring to your organization.
- New technical focus training. Partners have been asking for more enhanced technical training, so these training modules have been developed with this in mind. Here we will have a conversation about the new technical training tracks that will be available and how to complete these courses to get additional technical badges allowing partners to demonstrate to customers the high level of skill within their team.
- The new VeeamIQ partner catalogue, how to navigate it and why this makes it easier for partners to find the training they are looking for.


[Note: This is an on-demand session, so you do not need to attend at the scheduled time to view it]
