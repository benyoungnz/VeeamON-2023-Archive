## Abstract
We know behind all successful businesses are IT professionals working around the clock to keep systems running smoothly and putting out fires. The last thing they want is to spend time on manual tasks, overspending on software and storage, or feeling like they are one small step away from something breaking. Veeam has remained well-loved among short-staffed IT shops because it’s built on image-based backups, enabling users to easily set policies for a variety of workloads.

 

In this session, two of our small business experts will highlight nine features of the Veeam Data Platform they think offer more bang-for-the-buck, including:


- Storage-agnostic designs, enabling you to use existing storage
- Veeam Explorers, for fast, painless recoveries
- Veeam ONE monitored alerts, for peace of mind not usually afforded in SMB-class solutions


You’ll walk away from this session with nine features that will help you stretch your budget further, and put break/fix in the rear-view mirror so you can get back to the pile of other IT tasks you’ve been putting off!
