## Abstract
Each day, Ciox serves up hundreds of thousands of medical records to its customers, empowering them to provide high-quality, cost-effective healthcare services. Interruptions or delays are not an option, so the company turned to Veeam to ensure maximum uptime and optimal cyber-resilience across the multi cloud. Join this session with Ciox’s CISO, Robbie Hudec, and Veeam’s Director of Public Cloud Product Marketing, Sam Nicholls, to hear first-hand experience on decommissioning the data center, going multi-cloud, and the challenges and successes along the way. Learn how Veeam supports Ciox’s multi-cloud strategy, including:
- Perfecting protection across AWS, Microsoft Azure and a colocation
- Avoiding platform lock-in and lock-out by mobilizing data across clouds
- Controlling cloud costs to free up resources for new investments
