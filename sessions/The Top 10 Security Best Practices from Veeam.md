## Abstract
In this presentation, Veeam's lead global trainers will walk you through the top 10 security best practices from Veeam. For each solution, "the why" will be explained along with a live demo to ensure you maximize your learning and benefit in helping you drive operational resiliency with fortified backups. Examples include:


- Deploying your first hardened repository with immutability and how to lock it down securely
- Multi-Factor Authentication for your Backup & Replication console and your backup server
- Feature to enable a "Secure by design" approach - build the fence then put something inside
