## Abstract
Business needs change and transformations happen all the time and we never know what's around the corner, including Ransomware. Companies transform and change in many ways. There are new workloads and mandates to move to the cloud, or back on premises. What remains constant is the need to protect your data! Veeam has a way to ensure you get the latest capabilities and best protection with a portable, flexible solution that meets your ever-changing needs without being locked-in. Veeam Universal License (VUL) is here to support all of your data protection needs, ensuring no workload goes unprotected – or vulnerable to cyberattack.  

 

In this session, the Veeam Team will highlight how easy it is for current end users to leverage VUL, protecting every piece of data across on premises, cloud, edge and more with the latest set of innovations and enhancements ALWAYS included. Plus, we’ll discuss the experience Eric Norman, Head of Infrastructure Architecture & Innovation for Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG), has had with VUL. From speeding time to value for innovation efforts, to protecting different hypervisors, cloud services and more, all from a single license – VUL has aligned to the strategic vision IHG holds for innovation. 

 

Join us to see how you can unleash the full power of Veeam!
