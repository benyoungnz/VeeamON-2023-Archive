## Abstract
When most IT departments think of protecting their data, their strategies primarily revolve around protecting virtual machines. Although VMs account for the majority of data protection in enterprises, many other workloads still need to be protected, such as network storage or physical machines. Often times this leads to multiple toolsets, requiring specialized knowledge, and usually at an increased cost. Increased complexity is the last thing you want to deal with when a disaster strikes.

Â 

In this session, we'll discuss some of the tools and features already available today that customers can use to protect their non-virtualized workloads. Whether you need to protect your NAS data, physical servers, or enterprise applications, Veeam has you covered. We'll review not only what these features are and their best practices but also make sure we cover design decisions and recovery options.
