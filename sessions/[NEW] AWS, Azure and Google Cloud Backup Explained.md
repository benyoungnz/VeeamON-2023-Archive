## Abstract
In our recent Cloud Protection Trends survey, organizations noted that 47% of their infrastructure now lives in the cloud – and while the cloud is highly available, it’s not impervious to accidental deletion and ransomware attacks. With Veeam, backup administrators can take a policy-based approach to data protection, ensuring all workloads are recovery-ready. In this session, Veeam’s cloud product experts will walk Veeam users through the basics of cloud backup, including Veeam’s cloud native design principles, centralized monitoring and management techniques, immutable backups for ransomware resiliency, and cost-saving storage techniques to keep bill shock down.
