Ransomware attacks need to be viewed under the same category as power outages and natural disasters. If detection and prevention mechanisms fail to stop ransomware in its tracks, a speedy recovery is critical. Join this session with Veeam's Rick Vanover and Brad Linch, as they will walk you through and show you how Veeam offers the best recovery options in the industry through:Â
