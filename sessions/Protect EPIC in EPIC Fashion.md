## Abstract
The EPIC software suite is the most critical application for healthcare providers today and is vital to patient care and continued operations. Veeam protects everything within the EPIC software suite. EPIC has strict backup and restore windows that must be met to be within compliance. In this session with Veeam's Brett Rauber and Tom Duane, you will learn how Veeam protects EPIC, and why Veeam can exceed RPO/RTO windows set by EPIC. In addition, 2-3 real-world company examples will be provided to give you an idea of what is possible.Â [Note: This is an on-demand session, so you do not need to attend at the scheduled time to view it]
