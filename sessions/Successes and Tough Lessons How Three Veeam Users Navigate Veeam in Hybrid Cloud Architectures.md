## Abstract
As supply chains loosen, and storage vendors make progress clearing order backlogs, many organizations are taking stock of their infrastructure evolution in a post-COVID world. Most are more cloudy than ever before, with our recent Data Protection Trends Report for 2023 showing 47% of storage is hosted in the cloud vs physical or virtual servers on premises. This rapid shift leaves many open questions around cost management, cyber resiliency and the strategic importance of backup. 

In this session, three Veeam users discuss the key investments their organizations made in cloud storage, from new IaaS/PaaS/SaaS projects, to object storage implementations for immutable backups. Theyâ€™ll highlight capabilities in the Veeam Data Platform that helped them keep up with innovation, and challenges they faced with internal decision making and execution. Attendees will walk away from this session with actionable steps they can take to expand their usage of Veeam to the cloud, and talking points for internal discussions to make the expansion a reality.
