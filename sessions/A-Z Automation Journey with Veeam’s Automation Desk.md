## Abstract
Ansible, Brackets, Chocolatey, Dashboards, Errors, Functions... It's impossible to step into the IT world without running into some kind of automation requirement and if you are not already automating some part of your job you are likely doing more work than you need to. But automation can be a double edge sword of deep welled rabbit holes if you don't know where to start or have the right tools. 

In this session join Maurice Kevenaar and Joe Houghes to either start your journey into the wonderful world of Automation or expand your existing knowledge with our experiences.
