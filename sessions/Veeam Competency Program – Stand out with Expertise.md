## Abstract
How do you get noticed amongst the crowd? Let your Veeam expertise speak loudly with a Veeam Competency badge.

 

The Veeam Competency Program strengthens the collaboration between a partner and Veeam by offering greater market visibility for a partner’s solution offerings. Partners that meet our Veeam-verified criteria will be badged with Veeam competency logos that represent their ability to advise on and implement specific Veeam solutions.

 

The Veeam Competency program is designed to:

 


- Recognize and differentiate partners who have developed specialized Veeam-powered solutions, completed specialized training and/or met go-to-market requirements in the badged solution area.
- Build an expert partner network for strategic workload and solutions-focused competencies globally.
- Give partners the visibility to promote their differentiated offerings and expertise.


 

Becoming a Veeam Competency Partner gives current and potential customers the confidence that you have the technical savvy, relevant knowledge, and market readiness to support their unique needs in a specific use case.
