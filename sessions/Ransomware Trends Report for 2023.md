## Abstract
While Ransomware remains one of the top topics of conversation in 2023, many are unable to discuss their experiences publicly. Veeam commissioned a third-party survey of 1,200 IT Leaders from organizations of all sizes to share their experiences preventing, and recovering from, cyberattacks.  

 

In this Industry Insights livestream, Dave Russell (VP Enterprise Strategy, Veeam) and Jason Buffington (VP Market Strategy, Veeam) will highlight some of the top trends, insights and organizational plans from the report. Join us to kick off the VeeamON Livestreams from the show floor in Miami!
