## Abstract
In this session, hear from Eric Kubla from First Commonwealth Bank for real world Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) advice. Eric’s role as an IT Server Manager puts the business first in ensuring that in the event things don’t go as planned, that the IT services will resume. Veeam replication for the BC/DR use case is capable, critical and common. Eric’s experience will show you what to do and what you should know to prepare your BC/DR strategy and how you too can love Veeam replication.
