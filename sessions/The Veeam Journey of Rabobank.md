## Abstract
Five years ago, the implementation of Veeam within Rabobank started as a financially-driven replacement of their previous backup solution. Shortly after this decision, additional requirements to protect Rabobank against ransomware were introduced; an immutable third copy is created as part of this protection strategy, along with building an isolated clean-room. Now Rabobank would like to share with others the lessons they learned during this journey, specifically how Veeam enables Rabobank's cybersecurity strategy and what they learned from building a clean-room.
