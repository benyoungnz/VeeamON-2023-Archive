## Abstract
Ransomware, malware, insider attacks or just plain natural disasters are all factors that must be accounted for when keeping the #1 international airline up in the air. In this session, you will learn how Ryanair transformed its traditional backup infrastructure to a fortified infrastructure allowing for secure and high-performance backups while ensuring manageability and effortless restores. Network segmentation, credential segmentation, immutability, and tape are all key solutions as the 3-2-1 rule was achieved.
