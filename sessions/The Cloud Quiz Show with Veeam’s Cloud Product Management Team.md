## Abstract
From the litany of creatively named cloud services, to the ever-expanding core concepts required to get where you need without ballooning costs, the cloud can be a minefield of gotchas and acronyms standing in the way of your IT goals. As Veeam expands into object storage, containers, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS offerings, we want to bring our community of backup users together to knowledge share on all things cloud.

 

In this session, members of our Cloud Product Management Team will participate in a Jeopardy-style Quiz Show designed to define cloud services, demystify design principles, and discuss management and governance principles. Audience members will walk away with a greater understanding of cloud technologies, and an expanded network of Veeam cloud experts!
