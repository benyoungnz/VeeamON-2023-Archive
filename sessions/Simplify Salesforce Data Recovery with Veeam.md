## Abstract
Are you a backup administrator being asked to expand your sphere of control to your organizations SaaS installations? Have you ever wondered what it’s like for Salesforce administrators to back up and recover using the first party, native tools like the recycle bin, or export/import? Well we will show you what that looks like. Veeam Backup for Salesforce can make life so much easier for backup and app owner teams alike!

 

Join Veeam's Aaron Murphy, Field CTO for the Americas, and Alison Connor, Senior Product Marketing Manager for Salesforce, for a Salesforce expert-journey to painless recoveries and how Veeam can simplify on ways we support recovery of common Salesforce data loss scenarios.
