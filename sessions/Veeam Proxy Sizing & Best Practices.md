## Abstract
Become a proxy pro! Veeam Backup Proxies are a critical part of any deployment, ensuring deduplication, compression, encryption and more don't disrupt other critical backup functions. Optimizing your proxies is especially critical for users backing up NAS, VM backups, file backups, or leveraging Continuous Data Protection (CDP). 

 

Join two of Veeam's Solutions Architects as they detail sizing principles, best practices from the field, advanced configurations and more. Don't miss your chance to right-size your existing proxies, validate location and scale designs, and shorten backup windows!
