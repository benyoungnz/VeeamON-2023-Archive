## Abstract
Are you seeing more Kubernetes out in the field? This session is going to dive into the story behind Kasten K10 and the integration points we have today and moving forward. This session will be packed with demonstrations (albeit it might be using non-GA code), feature plenty of interactivity and there may even be prizes up for grabs.

SPOILER ALERT: It is not all one-way traffic when it comes to innovation, as you are going to see some of the famous technology that Veeam brings to the party being used in the Kubernetes data management space as well! Come on by if you want to stay up to date on what we have been doing with Kasten K10 and Veeam.
