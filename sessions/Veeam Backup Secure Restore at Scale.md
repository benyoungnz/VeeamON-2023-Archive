## Abstract
As ransomware attacks proliferate, the last line of defense for many organizations may be a restored backup. But before the mount and restore can take place, the backups should be scanned for infection. Veeam always pushes the boundaries of solution integrations, and antivirus support is no exception.

 

In this session, users will experience the end-to-end experience of testing backups at scale with Veeam Secure Restore in Veeam Backup & Replication using two of Microsoft’s most important security solutions: Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel. From validating the cleanliness of the machine, to automated backup checks, to stories from the field of real-world customer implementations, this session is a must-attend for any users planning to tighten up their ransomware recovery plans.
