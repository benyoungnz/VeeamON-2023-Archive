## Abstract
From cloud-first mandates, to the increasing presence of cybersecurity threats, there are many forces IT teams of state and local government organizations need to contend with. No one wants to generate headlines for data loss or service outages, so they need the confidence they can recover and maintain continuity of service for their constituents. In this panel, hosted by Veeam’s VP of Product Solution Strategy, you’ll hear from a panel of Veeam government customers as they discuss pitfalls of modernization projects, cyber resilience strategies, and the key ways Veeam supported their recovery strategies.
