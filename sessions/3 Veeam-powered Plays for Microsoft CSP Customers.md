## Abstract
In this session, join Leah Troscianecki and Karinne Bessette as they explore working together with the Veeam Cloud & Service Provider (VCSP), Veeam Accredited Service Partner (VASP) and Microsoft Cloud Service Provider programs. You will discover how the relationship between the companies has created a profitable ecosystem for partners and how to maximize profiles in both provider relationships.
