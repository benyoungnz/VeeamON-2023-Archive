## Abstract
Veeam is all about community, bringing users together to share best practices, tough lessons and collaborate on innovation ideas. To help Veeam end users and partners expand their networks, we've established the Veeam Community Hub, a collaboration portal with discussion boards, script libraries, blogs and more.

 

Join Madi and Safiya, our Community Leaders, for an Everything You Need To Know session covering:


- Influencer programs
- Top content resources you never knew existed
- Virtual and in-person user events
- And more!


 

Don't miss your chance to hear what's new, now and next for the Veeam Community!
