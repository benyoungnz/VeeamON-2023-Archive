## Abstract
ExaGrid continues to advance its integration with Veeam. As of V12, ExaGrid supports Veeam Fast Clone synthetic fulls, providing 30x faster performance. ExaGrid also is the only storage solution that provides automatic resynthesis of the synthetic fulls into actual full backups, allowing for the fastest restores & VM boots in the industry.

 

Ready for Ransomware Attacks:

ExaGrid’s Retention Time-Lock for Ransomware Recovery (RTL) combines ExaGrid’s non-network-facing repository tier (tiered air gap) with immutable data objects and a delayed delete policy to ensure data will be available for recovery in the event of a ransomware attack.

The combination of ExaGrid and Veeam keeps data protected and always available even when your organization is faced with security threats such as natural disasters and malicious attacks.

 

In this session, we will explore the benefits of ExaGrid-Veeam integration, including:


- Improved Backup and Restore Performance:

- ExaGrid writes Veeam backups directly to a disk-cache Landing Zone, ensuring the highest possible backup performance and fastest restores. Adaptive Deduplication performs deduplication and replication in parallel with backups so that RTO and RPO SLAs can be easily met. 
- Veeam and ExaGrid deliver the lowest multi-year TCO by preserving your initial investment and providing for low cost future expansion.
- Veeam’s Scale-Out Backup Repository combined with ExaGrid’s scale-out architecture delivers automatic VM load balancing, improved backup resiliency, simplified deployment, and easy backup data expansion.
- ExaGrid easily scales to accommodate data growth, adding full appliances to a scale-out system with capacities of up to a 2.7PB full backup plus retention and an ingest rate of up to 488TB per hour, the largest and fastest in the industry.
- How You can Save on Long-Term Retention Costs with the ExaGrid-Veeam Combined Deduplication:
- Veeam has data deduplication and a “dedupe friendly” compression setting which reduces the size of the Veeam backups in a way that allows the ExaGrid system to achieve further deduplication, which greatly reduces the amount of disk storage required.
- ExaGrid’s Unique Integration with Veeam:
- Through its unique architecture and Landing Zone, ExaGrid is the only backup storage solution that delivers fast backup, fast restores, scale-out backup storage and low cost for long term retention
