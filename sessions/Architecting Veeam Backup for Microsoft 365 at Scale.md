## Abstract
Designing Backup for Microsoft 365 data is completely different when you are dealing with thousands of users as opposed to hundreds. But what if you have to handle 40,000 users? As an Enterprise focused VASP architect and an architect at Veeam's largest Service Provider, we have designed systems for Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 to handle some of the largest organizations anywhere in the world. In this session we'll cover best practices and guidance for designing for success backup solutions for large scale organizations and multi-tenancy. This session will cover:


- Organization discovery and designing the backup infrastructure
- Job best practices
- Automation of large scale setup
- And finally, monitoring and troubleshooting gotchas
