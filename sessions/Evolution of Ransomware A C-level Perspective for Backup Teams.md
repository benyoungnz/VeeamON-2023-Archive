## Abstract
Tamecka McKay is the Chief Information Officer for The City of Fort Lauderdale. She recently joined Danny Allan, Veeam’s CTO and SVP of Product Strategy, at the V12 Launch Event, discussing the strategic data management imperatives for her organization. In this session, we’ll dive deeper into her unique perspective as an information technology leader, discussing with Edwin Weijdema, a Field CTO for Veeam, her plans for innovation for 2023 and beyond including:


- Keeping data protection at the forefront of her team’s projects
- How she’s setting a culture of collaboration and innovation across business units
- Pushing for the centralization, standardization and modernization of IT investments
- And more!


Ransomware remains a top-of-mind concern for all C-level executives, a threat Tamecka is all-too familiar with from previous experience. From implementing self-service recovery for disparate business units, to leveraging immutable backups for Ransomware resiliency, standardizing her organization on Veeam will offer tremendous strategic benefits.

 

Join Tamecka and Edwin to hear what’s top-of-mind from the C-suite, gather lessons from the field, and walk away with the perspectives and talking points you need to advocate for innovation within your own organization or government.
