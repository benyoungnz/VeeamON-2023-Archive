## Abstract
Do you have a big environment full of servers, workstations and laptops? Have you ever thought about how to protect machines sitting in remote locations or even home offices?

Â 

In this session, we cover all of this. Join us to review the design and deployment of a Veeam infrastructure for effective, centrally managed backup of thousands of machines. Based on different scenarios and requirements, we will go through the possible design choices, discussing pros and cons, sharing best practices, tips from hands-on experience in the field and some last-minute news and updates from the performance labs. You don't want to miss this sessions with Danilo and Dmitry where you can learn how design matches real world best practices and get the needed knowledge to implement physical backup at a large scale with the latest V12! And we will talk object storage too!
