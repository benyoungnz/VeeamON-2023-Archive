## Abstract
As workloads rapidly refactor and transform from on-premises infrastructure to cloud hosting, and as threats to resiliency push organizations to standardize their protection across databases, applications and more – it falls on partners like you to assemble a stack of solutions that maximizes investments and mitigates risk.

In this session, two of Veeam’s product marketing leaders, alongside a channel-aligned field engineering, will walk attendees through:


- The benefits of the Veeam Universal License, and how this model can be the literal key to transformational success
- Resources designed to support customer readiness assessments, self-service license upgrades, and more
- The top upsell and cross-sell capabilities to drive additional value with your customers
- An overview of the Veeam Extents, supporting backup of SaaS and containers
- And more!


Whether you’re a long-time Veeam partner, or early in your Veeam experience, this session will unlock valuable messaging, tools and more so you can support value-add conversations as you seek to future-proof your customers purchases.
