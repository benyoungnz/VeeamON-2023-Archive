## Abstract
Kubernetes is just another platform, concentrating on containerisation. You are all familiar with virtualisation and most of you will be focused on VMware vSphere which as you know is a platform for virtualisation and more recently a place in which you can also now run Kubernetes in the form of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.

In this session we will walk through the correlation between virtualization and Kubernetes and how it is not that far away from what you are used to with vSphere. At the end of the day, Kubernetes is made up of compute, storage, and networking, very much the same as a virtualization platform. We are going to breakdown some of the seemingly daunting aspects of Kubernetes and also give you the building blocks of Kubernetes.
