## Abstract
Join us to unpack the Microsoft 365 backup experiences, strategies, and best practices from three Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 customers – Dave Loveless (Infrastructure Manager at Admiral – Financial Services), Matthew Prieto (Director of Infrastructure and Security – Food and Agriculture), Eric Addington (Manager, Systems Infrastructure and Tech Apps - Healthcare) – moderated by Russ Kerscher (Senior Director of Product Marketing). In this panel interview-style session, we will uncover:


- Each of their unique Microsoft 365 environments and why they chose to backup their data
- What they looked for in a backup solution and how they settled on using Veeam
- Challenges they overcame, best practices and tips they would recommend that you can use when protecting your own Microsoft 365 data
