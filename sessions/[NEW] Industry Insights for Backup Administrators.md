## Abstract
It’s a bit predictable and overused to wield phrases like ‘we’re at an inflection point’ – but over the past few years the backup and BC/DR spaces have experienced significant shifts, demanding transformational change due to the myriad of new platforms being used and the heightening pressure that all organizations are under to ensure access to their data. 

To support backup professionals in their 2023 goals, the Veeam Team partners with outside research firms to survey organizations on a host of topics. In this session, two of our strategy leaders will highlight our Data Protection Trends Report, a survey of 4,200+ organizations from around the world. From the preponderance of ransomware attacks to desired outcomes of backup software upgrades, this report has everything you need to drive conversations about the importance of backup and recovery within your organization.
