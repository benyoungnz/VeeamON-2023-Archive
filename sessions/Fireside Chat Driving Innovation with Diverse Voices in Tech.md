## Abstract
Throughout the technology industry, there are several diversity gaps present, and as a result, companies are missing out on increased innovation, increased efficiency, and increased profits. Research by McKinsey, Harvard Business Review, and Deloitte, all exhibit compelling evidence that diversity unlocks innovation and correlates with more profitability.

 

In this fireside chat, leaders in the Veeam community will come together to discuss their experiences, best practices, and advice on how to build and cultivate diverse teams that drive innovation. Hosted by Veeam’s Vice President of Corporate Marketing, Neenu Sharma, and former Chief Diversity Officer in tech, this diverse group of leaders will touch on allyship and advocacy, growing your own career, and using your voice to give voice to others.
