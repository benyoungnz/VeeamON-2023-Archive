## Abstract
Dustin and Anthony are back again with the fifth edition of CUMULONIMBUS. This time around we will be taking a higher level look at the importance of Object Storage in modern IT platforms and how Veeam, together with its alliance and storage partners, have continued to build on the innovative Object Storage technology, first seen in Veeam Backup & Replication v9.5 Update 4. V12 has brought a lot of improvements to our support of Object Storage, so join Veeam's Dustin Alberston and Anthony Spiteri, as they will look back through the years to take a peek forward at what's to come for Object Storage technologies and integrations...not only for secondary backup platforms, but also primary use cases moving forward.
