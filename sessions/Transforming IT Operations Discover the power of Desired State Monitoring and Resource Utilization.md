## Abstract
Desired state monitoring and resource utilization are critical components of effective IT operations. They help ensure that systems are configured as intended, and that resources are being used efficiently. In this talk, we will discuss and write an real world application that utilizes the Veeam Backup & Replication APIs to pull these data points out and compare this with the rules we define.

 

If that's not enough...we will then extend the application to alert any rule violations to external systems such as centralised monitoring, on-call paging systems and enterprise communication tools.

 

This talk is a must-see for anyone looking to optimize their IT operations.
