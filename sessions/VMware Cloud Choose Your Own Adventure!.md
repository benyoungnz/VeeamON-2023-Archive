## Abstract
Are you struggling with the complexities and costs of backing up your VMware workloads in a public cloud? Don't worry, because we have the solution! Join us for an exhilarating adventure into the world of public clouds, where we'll explore the many flavors of VMware clouds and discover the hidden gems and secret powers of each one.

 

In this session, we'll take a deep dive into how V12 simplifies backup architecture and drives down cost. We'll explore how direct-to-object storage, and the ability to migrate repositories, can eliminate the need for costly block-based repositories running in the cloud. Our expert guides, Bene and Andy, will help you navigate the complex terrain of cost, scalability, and security, as we uncover the unique features and capabilities of each VMware-based public cloud.

 

By the end of this presentation, you'll have a deep understanding of the advantages and trade-offs of using a VMware-based public cloud, and the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on the best solution for your organization.
