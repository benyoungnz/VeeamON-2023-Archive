## Abstract
As ransomware has become more and more of a threat, reliable backups are being seen more and more as a part of an overall cybersecurity strategy. Unfortunately, there is often little communication between backup tools and cybersecurity tools. Integrations between backup tools (such as Veeam) and endpoint EDR/XDR (Cortex, or others) along with cybersecurity automation (XSOAR) can solve this problem by not only preventing ransomware, but automating a response from the cybersecurity suite if it is detected.

Â 

Join this session and be walked through the following steps involving SIEM and Veeam:


- Automate SureBackup scans using Cortex XDR (or similar) endpoint protection.
- In the event of ransomware detection, Veeam ONE alerts are picked up by a security automation tool (XSOAR or similar).
- Security event is generated in a SIEM.
- Automated action is taken by either Veeam or the SIEM and logged against the incident.
- Profit?
