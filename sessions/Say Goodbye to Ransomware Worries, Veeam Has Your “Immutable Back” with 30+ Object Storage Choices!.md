## Abstract
Immutability continues to be a hot topic especially when it comes to ransomware and security, but did you know Veeam partners with 30+ different vendors that offer object storage with immutability? With all the options, it can be difficult to choose the right type that fits the needs of your infrastructure and business. How do you estimate the cost to use on-premises immutability vs object lock immutability in the public cloud? Are there pros and cons to use multiple in conjunction to have immutability at every layer? Join Veeam Technologists Emilee Tellez and Kirsten Stoner, as they discuss the best practices for monitoring, and implementing immutability both on-premises and in the cloud to better understand what immutability design choices will work best for you!
