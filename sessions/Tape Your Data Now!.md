## Abstract
What’s something that every hacker hates? Multi-factor authentication? True… but what’s something more old school than that? Tape!

Yes, tape is the cheapest way to protect huge data lakes, and at the same time, offers immutable, air gapped and resilient storage. At Veeam, we see the future of tape storage very clearly, which is why Veeam Backup & Replication v12 comes with a mountain of feature enhancements designed to help keep your business up and running.

Join this session to run down the latest enhancements, including best practices for organizing tape storage more efficiently, and to share feedback with the Veeam Product Management team!
