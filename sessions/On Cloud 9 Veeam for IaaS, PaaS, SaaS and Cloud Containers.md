## Abstract
Backup experts know all too well that software built for on premises environments lack the optimizations and intergrations to simply work in the cloud. Meanwhile, cloud teams wonder why their backup and security teammates are breathing down their necks trying to install a backup software that simply isn’t cloud-native.

This session will feature two of Veeam’s cloud experts as they demystify some of the challenges your company may be facing as backup, security and cloud teams collide. From top-of-mind concerns like cost management, to "keep you up at night" fears of cybersecurity attack vectors, this session will lay out 9 key concerns for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and Containers - and arm you with the cloud-native capabilities Veeam has available to tackle them head on. Backed by key industry insights, this session will help you value-add in corporate strategic conversations about the cloud, ensuring backup and recovery is well-represented as "cloud-first" mandates abound.
