## Abstract
With the increase in cyberattacks, the government has put in place strict security measures to ensure that critical information is protected. Executive Order 14028 and various security standards such as SSDF, CMMC, DoDIN APL, IPv6, FIPS, NIST, among others, mandate modernized approaches to cybersecurity. These standards provide essential guidelines for ensuring the security of cloud services, advancing towards Zero Trust Architecture, and ensuring a secure software supply chain.

 

In this session we’ll discuss how Veeam’s V12 platform and internal processes address these security mandates to deliver mission continuity for both private and public sector customers. We’ll review how V12:


- Addresses all aspects of cybersecurity, including data protection, disaster recovery, and security management.
- Includes advanced encryption technologies to protect data both in transit and at rest.
- Provides assurance via a secure software supply chain development process.
- Drives compliance with government security mandates.
