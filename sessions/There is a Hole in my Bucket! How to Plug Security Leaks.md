## Abstract
Object storage offers the promise of cost savings, storage elasticity, security, and more. In V12, Veeam expanded it's support of object storage to include direct-to-object-storage designs, a great option for edge devices and other workloads with flexible RTOs.

 

In this session, two of Veeam's Senior Solutions Architects will outline the supporting architecture and components needed to leverage object storage buckets as a primary repository for storage.

 

Then, they will dive deeper into advanced lockdown techniques, leveraging immutable backup features to ensure operational resiliency in the face of ransomware, insider threats and more.

 

You'll walk away from this session with actionable insights needed to stretch cloud investments to their fullest potential, and plug any holes before they leak!
