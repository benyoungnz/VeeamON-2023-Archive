## Abstract
In early 2023, Veeam launched a wave of innovations designed to improve cyber resiliency across hybrid and multi cloud environments. With more critical company data hosted in hyperscale public clouds than ever before, organizations need an operationally consistent backup solution for data center, edge and cloud. With Veeam, we have that covered.

 

This session is a great opportunity for Veeam power-users, and those new to backup, to learn more about how Veeam is making IaaS and PaaS investments more secure and resilient. Veeam Backup for AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are all offerings designed to natively protect cloud-hosted workloads like compute, databases and file shares. And with the 2023 releases, new immutability support, enhanced scalability for large environments, and support for additional cloud services means it’s a great time to check them out and get started on your next Veeam expansion project!
