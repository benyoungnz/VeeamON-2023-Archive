## Abstract
Join the Veeam Team for a sit-down conversation from the VeeamON floor with David Loveless, Domain Lead for Storage and Data Centre from Admiral, and Zane Allyn, Principal Technologist for Pure Storage. Admiral has executed several transformation initiatives with Veeam, including protection of their Microsoft 365 data.

In this session, this group will discuss how Admiral partnered with Veeam and Pure Storage to architect a backup and retention strategy that future-proofed their infrastructure. From implementing immutable storage, to improving backup speed by 90%, this better together strategy ensures they are allocating resources effectively while staying resilient from ransomware attack.
