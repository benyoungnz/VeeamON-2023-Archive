## Abstract
Join this session to become a mass recovery hero! Ransomware, natural disasters and other data loss events mean that you don't just need to be able to recover fast (Veeam has that covered, of course) but you also need to be able to recover in bulk. Mass recovery has become an imperative as organizations prepare their ransomware recovery strategy and the criticality of their data increases. In this session we will use Veeam Recovery Orchestrator to demonstrate a live mass recovery in the face of a ransomware attack that takes out applications within our VMware cluster. We will then go behind the scenes to show you how this was done and how you can adopt strategies to make sure you're ready to be a recovery hero.
