## Abstract
Cloud storage and services have undeniably disrupted the data protection space. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) all have demands for data protection – but often require different methodologies, perspectives and even responsibilities across the IT organization.   

In this Industry Insights livestream, Dave Russell (VP Enterprise Strategy, Veeam) and Jason Buffington (VP Market Strategy, Veeam) will discuss the outputs from a survey of 1,700 IT leaders, including: 


- Whose job it is to back up the cloud  
- What determines which workloads run in a cloud  
- What role Backup as a Service (BaaS) and Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) play in the strategy  
- And more!  


Watch as Jason and Dave close out VeeamON from the show floor, joining the Veeam Team in person or virtually – the best of both worlds for this hybrid event!
