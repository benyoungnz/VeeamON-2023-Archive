## Abstract
France was one of the top five countries hit by ransomware attacks in 2022. Healthcare has been one of the most impacted sectors and all three speakers for this session work in healthcare: Eric as a CISO/CTO in a healthcare solution provider, Julien as a CTO Cybersecurity in an ICT company, and Christopher as a CTO in an ICT and Security Services Provider company. Over the past few years, they have all been involved with their customers in several cyberattacks via intrusion, data theft, ransomware, and more. Unsolved, these attacks can have major consequences on your company. Based on the speakers' experience, theyâ€™ll share with you what happens during a ransomware attack and their best practices to react faster with efficiency. By sharing their combined experiences and the tips they've learned along the way, they hope to help you avoid these kind of cyberattacks from happening to you and your company and if they do, what you can do to quickly recover.
