## Abstract
The Veeam Hardened Repository is one of the easiest ways to achieve on-premises immutability. Join Veeam's Rick Vanover and Hannes Kasparick for this demo-only session, as they will walk through an Ubuntu system setup for use with the Veeam Hardened Repository. From a base operating system to backups on disk with immutable file attributes, this session will walk through the how-to for the Hardened Repository.
