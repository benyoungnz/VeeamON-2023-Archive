## Abstract
What if we told you that you could be up and running with Veeam Backup for Salesforce in less time than it takes to watch your two favorite episodes of The Office? Once deployed, our newest product release offers organizations the ease and flexibility to run backup policies and restore jobs in minutes. Better yet, it offers an operationally consistent experience across other Veeam solutions, making it an easy-to-deploy solution for power users of Veeam.
