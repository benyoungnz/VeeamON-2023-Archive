## Abstract
With organizations around the world looking to refactor and migrate workloads to the cloud, many find they are lacking a critical piece of the puzzle: cloud-specific skills on staff. This is where partners come in – Veeam Cloud & Service Provider (VCSP) partners are uniquely positioned to help customers seize the power of the cloud, increasing efficiencies and innovating along their journey.

 

In this session, two VCSP technical experts will show service providers how they can setup integrations between the Veeam Service Provider Console and Veeam’s cloud native offerings for AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. They will also walk through how to create an external repository to target data outside of the public cloud, offering flexible recovery to avoid cloud lock-in/out.

 

Don’t miss your chance to see the latest releases for service providers in action, and provide customers with the cloud resiliency and transformation they need to stay ahead!
